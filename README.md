# FiveM Archive Tool
# ! kuuplee11â„¢#0001

This is my first project on Python and is so simple.
It serves to create a FiveM script structure.
The use is simple, you just have to open the FiveMArchiveTool.py file, put the directory where you want it to be created and put the name of the main folder.
The strecute is this:

ðŸ“‚ (name of the folder)
  config.lua
  fxmainfest.lua
  ðŸ“‚ Server
     main.lua
  ðŸ“‚ Client
     main.lua
