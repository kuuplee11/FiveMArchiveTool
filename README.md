# FiveM Archive Tool
# ! kuuplee11â„¢#0001

This is my first project on Python and is so simple.
It serves to create a FiveM script structure.
The use is simple, you just have to open the FiveMArchiveTool.py file, put the directory where you want it to be created and put the name of the main folder.
The files that it create are this:
ðŸ“‚ Main Folder  config.lua  fxmainfext.lua | ðŸ“‚ Server  main.lua | ðŸ“‚ Client main.lua
